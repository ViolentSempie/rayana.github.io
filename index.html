        <p>Hi there, I am Rayana - a User Interface Engineer from Brazil, based in Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>I design digital interfaces, collaborating with an awesome team from around the world to create engaging and effective web experiences. I also still do the odd bit of freelance.</p>
        <p>I love cats, beer, from wireframes and prototypes to final art direction and visual design.</p>

        <div class="projects__info--description">
          <p>With a cool and confident atmosphere, The Daisy is an Agave Gastropub located in the Upper East Side featuring craft cocktails derived from Agave spirits paired with a eclectic food menu. The goal of this project was to design a femminine, vintage-classic looking website that would translate into all of the different touchpoints of a Gastropub that brings exceptional features and an exclusive mix of American and Mexican cuisine.</p>

          <p>As part of the deliverables, I drew wireframes and designed the views of all pages and states of the web site for desktop and mobile devices.</p>

          <h4>Designing end-to-end user experience of a new internal web application</h4>

        <div class="projects__info--description">
          <p><strong>This project is under NDA (non-disclosure-agreement).</strong> Only process related information can be exposed.</p>
          <p>This is a team project working with one of the biggest worldwide technology companies on the design of a system application tool. A series of methods were employed across different phases of the project, such as:</p>

          <h5>Wireframe prototyping</h5>
          <p>I generated rapid-prototyping user experience, high-fidelity mockups and interactive web & mobile prototypes (paper, Axure, Balsamic, Graffle, Sketch, Photoshop), allowing the design team to tangibilize ideas.</p>

          <h5>User Interface Engineering</h5>
          <p>I helped with front end development by transforming the component's designs into HTML/CSS templates. Our goal was to build a consistent UI Pattern Library built on top of the Bourbon and Ember.js frameworks, as well as a reusable set of accessible and content oriented markup patterns for a system application tool.</p>

          <p>Hands-on coding using HTML5, CSS3 (SASS and LESS), and the 'Block, Element, Modifier' (BEM) methodology.</p>

          <h5>Requirement Analysis</h5>
          <p>I analysed requirements, and estimated the UI development efforts & planned its implementation. Wrote user stories and acceptance criteria & prioritized backlog based on project's objectives. Ensured project requirements meet the documented acceptance criteria.</p>

          <h5>Web Accessibility</h5>
          <p>I was responsible for designing the application's User Interface Guidelines for web accessibility: Advocated and supported web accessibility methods as a core step on the software development process; Coded with semantically meaningful HTML; Designed web components for visually impaired users;  Made design considerations and validated the system's accessibility using assistive technologies.</p>

          <h5>Documentation</h5>
          <p>Artifacts from all phases were documented in a form of descriptive memorial so developers were able to work on a second part of the project.</p>

          <h4>Helping to develop a cross-platform application for access management</h4>

        <div class="projects__info--description">
          <p><strong>This project is under NDA (non-disclosure-agreement).</strong> Only process related information can be exposed.</p>
          <p>This is a team project working with one of the biggest worldwide technology companies on the design of a access management system of content and applications. Security was a key point on the development of the product, and I collaborated with designers across the company to ensure that multiple applications and groups were communicating as expected. A series of methods were employed across different phases of the project, such as:</p>
          
          <h5>Wireframe prototyping and User Interface Engineering</h5>
          <p>I gathered requirements for the interface components developed within the application and generated rapid-prototyping user experience, high-fidelity mockups and interactive web/mobile prototypes (paper, Axure, Balsamic, Graffle, Sketch, Photoshop), allowing the design team to tangibilize ideas.</p>
          <p>I then translated those requirements in valid and accessible HTML/CSS components that were later standardised and extracted to a UI Pattern Library built on top of Ember.js framework, developed for internal web applications of the client. Hands-on coding using HTML5, CSS3 (SASS and LESS), and the 'Block, Element, Modifier' (BEM) methodology.</p>

          <h5>Requirement Analysis</h5>
          <p>I analysed requirements, and estimated the UI development efforts & planned its implementation. Prioritized backlog based on project's objectives and ensured project requirements meet the documented acceptance criteria.</p>

          <h5>Quality Assurance</h5>
          <p>I worked closely with QA and engineering teams to investigate and resolve production issues. Part of my responsabilities were to validate the interface and behaviour of the application's components in both desktop and mobile devices, and to report and validate new bugs.</p>
          
          <h5>Documentation</h5>
          <p>Artifacts from all phases were documented in a form of descriptive memorial so developers were able to work on a second part of the project.</p>
