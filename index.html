          <h3>The Daisy — A gastro pub unlike any other in New York City</h3>

        <div class="projects__info--description">
          <p>With a cool and confident atmosphere, The Daisy is an Agave Gastropub located in the Upper East Side featuring craft cocktails derived from Agave spirits paired with a eclectic food menu. The goal of this project was to design a femminine, vintage-classic looking website that would translate into all of the different touchpoints of a Gastropub that brings exceptional features and an exclusive mix of American and Mexican cuisine.</p>

          <p>As part of the deliverables, I drew wireframes and designed the views of all pages and states of the web site for desktop and mobile devices.</p>

          <h3>Designing end-to-end user experience of a new internal web application</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="projects__info--description">
          <p><strong>This project is under NDA (non-disclosure-agreement).</strong> Only process related information can be exposed. This is a team project working with one of the biggest worldwide technology companies on the design of a system application tool. A series of methods were employed across different phases of the project, such as:</p>

          <h5>Wireframe prototyping</h5>
          <p>I generated rapid-prototyping user experience, high-fidelity mockups and interactive web & mobile prototypes (paper, Axure, Balsamic, Graffle, Sketch, Photoshop), allowing the design team to tangibilize ideas.</p>

          <h5>User Interface Engineering</h5>
          <p>I helped with front end development by transforming the component's designs into HTML/CSS templates. Our goal was to build a consistent UI Pattern Library built on top of the Bourbon and Ember.js frameworks, as well as a reusable set of accessible and content oriented markup patterns for a system application tool.
          Hands-on coding using HTML5, CSS3 (SASS and LESS), and the 'Block, Element, Modifier' (BEM) methodology.</p>

          <h5>Requirement Analysis</h5>
          <p>I analysed requirements, and estimated the UI development efforts & planned its implementation. Wrote user stories and acceptance criteria & prioritized backlog based on project's objectives. Ensured project requirements meet the documented acceptance criteria.</p>

          <h5>Web Accessibility</h5>
          <p>I was responsible for designing the application's User Interface Guidelines for web accessibility: Advocated and supported web accessibility methods as a core step on the software development process; Coded with semantically meaningful HTML; Designed web components for visually impaired users;  Made design considerations and validated the system's accessibility using assistive technologies.</p>

          <h5>Documentation</h5>
          <p>Artifacts from all phases were documented in a form of descriptive memorial so developers were able to work on a second part of the project.</p>
